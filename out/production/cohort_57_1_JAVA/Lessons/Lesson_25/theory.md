  <summary>1. What is Encapsulation?</summary>

## **What is Encapsulation?**

### **Definition and Importance of Encapsulation**

🔹 **Encapsulation** is one of the key principles of OOP, which means **hiding internal object data** and **restricting
access to it**.

The main goals of encapsulation:  
✔️ **Data Protection** – preventing direct modification of important object fields.  
✔️ **Access Control** – data can only be changed through methods.  
✔️ **Code Flexibility** – internal logic can be modified without affecting other parts of the code.

**Example without encapsulation (bad practice):**

```java
class BankAccount {
    String owner;
    double balance;
}
```

Here, **balance** is public and can be changed from outside without restrictions:

```java
BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
account.balance =-1000; // Error: Can set a negative balance!
```

To prevent such issues, we use **encapsulation**.

### **Analogy: File Access on a Computer**

Imagine your computer is a **class**, and the files on it have **different access levels**:

| **Modifier** | **Analogy on a Computer**                                 | **Who Can Open the File?**          |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `private`    | **Personal documents**                                    | Only the computer owner             |
| `default`    | **Work files in a local network**                         | Only colleagues in the same network |
| `protected`  | **Shared folder with a password**                         | Family members or selected users    |
| `public`     | **File on the internet (Google Docs with public access)** | Anyone on the internet              |

🔹 **Examples:**

- **`private`** – Your personal diary, which no one can open without a password.
- **`default`** – Files in an office network, accessible only to employees.
- **`protected`** – Family photos in the cloud, available only with a password.
- **`public`** – An open article on the internet, accessible to everyone.

### **Protecting Data with Access Modifiers**

In Java, **access modifiers** are used for encapsulation, controlling which parts of the code can interact with an
object's fields and methods.

| **Modifier** | **Accessible Inside Class** | **Accessible Inside Package** | **Accessible in Subclasses** | **Accessible in Other Classes** |
|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `private`    | ✅ Yes                       | ❌ No                          | ❌ No                         | ❌ No                            |
| `default`    | ✅ Yes                       | ✅ Yes                         | ❌ No                         | ❌ No                            |
| `protected`  | ✅ Yes                       | ✅ Yes                         | ✅ Yes                        | ❌ No                            |
| `public`     | ✅ Yes                       | ✅ Yes                         | ✅ Yes                        | ✅ Yes                           |

**How to properly protect data?**  
✔️ Use `private` for fields (so they cannot be modified directly).  
✔️ Provide access to data via **getters and setters**.  
✔️ Allow modifications only through methods with validation.

Example of **data encapsulation** in the `BankAccount` class:

```java
class BankAccount {
    private String owner;
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(String owner, double initialBalance) {
        this.owner = owner;
        if (initialBalance >= 0) {
            this.balance = initialBalance;
        } else {
            this.balance = 0;
            System.out.println("Balance cannot be negative. Set to 0.");
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposited: " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Deposit amount must be positive.");
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Withdrawn: " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds or invalid amount.");
        }
    }
}
```

Now, `balance` cannot be modified directly:

```java
BankAccount account = new BankAccount("Alice", 500);
account.

deposit(200);
account.

withdraw(1000); // Error: Insufficient funds
```

---

### **Real-World Analogy: Bank Account**

Imagine you have a **bank account**.

- You **cannot** simply set the balance by writing `balance = 100000;`
- The balance can **increase** only through deposits.
- The balance can **decrease** only through withdrawals.
- You cannot go into negative balance unless the bank allows overdrafts.

🔹 **The `BankAccount` class works the same way!** It hides `balance` and allows access to it **only through methods**
that validate operations.

## **Summary**

✅ **Encapsulation** protects data and controls access to it.  
✅ Class fields should be `private`, and access to them should be provided through methods.  
✅ **Analogy** – a bank account: access to the balance is only possible through transactions.

  <summary>2. Access Modifiers in Java</summary>

## **Access Modifiers in Java**

### **What Are Access Modifiers?**
🔹 **Access modifiers** are keywords in Java that define **the level of visibility and accessibility** of classes, methods, and fields in a program.

**Why are they important?**  
✔️ Allow **control over data access**.  
✔️ Protect **internal class logic** from misuse.  
✔️ Improve **code structure and readability**.

Java provides **four main access modifiers**:

| **Modifier**  | **Visible Inside Class** | **Visible in Package** | **Visible in Subclasses** | **Visible in Other Classes** |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| `private`    | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| `default` (no modifier) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| `protected`  | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| `public`     | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

---

### **Explanation of Modifiers with Examples**

#### **1. `private` – Full Control Inside the Class**
🔹 **Accessible only within the class itself**.  
🔹 Completely **hides data** from other classes.  
🔹 Used to **protect important data**, such as passwords or account balances.

**Example:**
```java
class User {
    private String password;

    public User(String password) {
        this.password = password;
    }

    private void encryptPassword() {
        System.out.println("Encrypting password...");
    }
}
```

**❌ Error: You cannot access `password` or call `encryptPassword()` from another class.**

---

#### **2. `default` (package-private) – Access Within the Same Package**
🔹 **Accessible within the same package**, but **not in other packages**.  
🔹 If **no modifier is specified**, `default` is used.  
🔹 Useful for classes that should interact **only within a module**.

**Example:**
```java
class PackageClass {
    String message = "Accessible only within this package!";
}
```

If another class **in the same package** tries to access `message`, it will work:  
```java
PackageClass obj = new PackageClass();
System.out.println(obj.message); // Works!
```

However, if the class is in **a different package**, access **will not be allowed**.

---

#### **3. `protected` – Access in Package + Inheritance**
🔹 Accessible to **all classes in the package** + **subclasses in other packages**.  
🔹 Allows **protected inheritance**: data is hidden from others but available to child classes.

**Example:**
```java
class Parent {
    protected String familySecret = "Family secret";
}
```

```java
class Child extends Parent {
    void revealSecret() {
        System.out.println(familySecret); // Works!
    }
}
```

If `Child` is in **a different package** but **inherits from Parent**, it can access `protected` fields.

---

#### **4. `public` – Full Access Anywhere**
🔹 **Accessible in any class and package**.  
🔹 Used for **public APIs and interfaces** that should be available everywhere.

**Example:**
```java
public class PublicClass {
public String greeting = "Hello, world!";
}
```

Any code can access `greeting`:  
```java
PublicClass obj = new PublicClass();
System.out.println(obj.greeting); // Works!
```

---

### **When and Why to Use Each Modifier?**

| **Modifier**  | **When to Use?** |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| `private`    | For **hidden data**, such as passwords, balances, internal methods. |
| `default`    | When a class or method **should not be visible outside the package**. |
| `protected`  | When you need to **allow subclass access** but hide from others. |
| `public`     | When **a method or class should be accessible to everyone** (e.g., API). |

---

## **Summary**
✅ **Access modifiers** manage data visibility in Java.  
✅ **`private`** protects data inside the class.  
✅ **`default`** works only within the same package.  
✅ **`protected`** is accessible to subclasses, even in other packages.  
✅ **`public`** allows unrestricted access everywhere.

🚀 **Next, we'll practice choosing the right access modifiers for various classes!**


<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary>Practice</summary>

### **Task: Choose the Right Access Modifiers**

Below are several classes with fields that currently have no access modifiers.  
Your task is to **assign appropriate modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`)** based on logic and encapsulation
principles.

---

```java
// TODO: Assign access modifiers to the fields based on best practices.

class UserAccount {
    String username;
    String password;
    String email;
    int age;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Assign access modifiers to the fields.

class BankAccount {
    String accountNumber;
    double balance;
    String ownerName;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Assign access modifiers to the fields.

class Product {
    String name;
    double price;
    int stock;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Assign access modifiers to the fields.

class Car {
    String brand;
    String model;
    int speed;
    double fuelLevel;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Assign access modifiers to the fields.

class LibraryBook {
    String title;
    String author;
    boolean isAvailable;
    String borrowerName;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Assign access modifiers to the fields.

class Order {
    int orderId;
    String customerName;
    double totalAmount;
    String status;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Assign access modifiers to the fields.

class Flight {
    String flightNumber;
    String destination;
    int availableSeats;
    String departureTime;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Assign access modifiers to the fields.

class ChatMessage {
    String sender;
    String receiver;
    String text;
    String timestamp;
}
```

---

### **Instructions:**

1. Review the fields in each class and decide which ones should be **`private`**, **`protected`**, or **`public`**.
2. Consider **which fields should be hidden (private)** and which should remain accessible.
3. Modify the classes accordingly.

🚀 **This exercise will help you understand how to properly encapsulate data in Java!**

  <summary><b>3. Getters and Setters</b></summary>

## **Getters and Setters in Java**

### **Why is Direct Access to Fields Bad Practice?**

🔹 **Direct access to fields (`public`) breaks encapsulation** and allows uncontrolled modifications.  
🔹 If fields are public, **any class can change them without restrictions**, leading to potential errors.  
🔹 Getters and setters **allow validation** before changing field values.

**Example of Bad Practice (No Encapsulation):**  
```java
class BankAccount {
    public double balance;
}
```

Here, any class can modify `balance` without control:  
```java
BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
account.balance = -1000; // ❌ Incorrect! The balance should not be negative.
```

To avoid such problems, **we use getters and setters**.

---

### **Implementing Getters and Setters**

🔹 **Getter (`get`)** – a method that allows reading the value of a private field.  
🔹 **Setter (`set`)** – a method that allows modifying the value with validation.

**Example: Correct Implementation Using Getters and Setters**  
```java
class BankAccount {
private double balance;

    public double getBalance() { // Getter
        return balance;
    }

    public void setBalance(double balance) { // Setter
        if (balance >= 0) {
            this.balance = balance;
        } else {
            System.out.println("❌ Balance cannot be negative!");
        }
    }
}
```

Now, an external class **cannot** modify `balance` directly but can use `setBalance()`, which includes validation.

**Usage:**  
```java
BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
account.setBalance(500);  // ✅ Correct
account.setBalance(-100); // ❌ Will print "Balance cannot be negative!"
System.out.println(account.getBalance()); // Prints 500
```



### **Example: `BankAccount` with Controlled Balance Modification**

A more advanced example where we also add `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods.

```java
class BankAccount {
private double balance;

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        if (initialBalance >= 0) {
            this.balance = initialBalance;
        } else {
            System.out.println("❌ Initial balance cannot be negative. Setting to 0.");
            this.balance = 0;
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() { // Getter
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("✅ Deposited: " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("❌ Deposit amount must be positive.");
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("✅ Withdrawn: " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("❌ Insufficient funds or invalid amount.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Usage:**  
```java
BankAccount account = new BankAccount(100);
account.deposit(50);
account.withdraw(200); // ❌ Insufficient funds
System.out.println("Balance: " + account.getBalance()); // ✅ 150
```

---

## **Summary**
✅ **Getters** allow reading private fields safely.  
✅ **Setters** validate data before modifying fields.  
✅ Encapsulation prevents **direct field modification**, reducing errors.

<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary><b>4. Practice: Getters, Setters, and `this`</b></summary>

## **Task: Implement Getters and Setters**

### **Exercise Goals**
✔️ Learn to use **getters and setters** to access private fields.  
✔️ Understand how **validation** in setters helps protect data.  
✔️ Practice using **the `this` keyword** to distinguish local variables from class fields.

---

### **Part 1: Basic Getters and Setters**
🔹 In the first two classes, you need to **implement simple getters and setters** without validation.

---

```java
// TODO: Add getters and setters for all fields.
class Book {
    private String title;
    private String author;
    private int pages;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Add getters and setters for all fields.
class User {
    private String username;
    private String email;
    private int age;
}
```

---

### **Part 2: Getters, Setters, and Validation**
🔹 In the next classes, you need to **implement getters and setters with validation**.

---

```java
// TODO: Implement getters and setters with validation.
// 1. The `balance` field cannot be negative.
// 2. The `accountNumber` field should not be changed after the object is created.
class BankAccount {
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Implement getters and setters with validation.
// 1. The `temperature` field must be within the range of -100 to 100 degrees.
// 2. The `condition` field can only be "Sunny", "Rainy", "Cloudy", or "Snowy".
class WeatherReport {
    private double temperature;
    private String condition;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Implement getters and setters with validation.
// 1. The `rating` field must be between 1 and 5.
// 2. The `reviewText` field cannot be empty.
class ProductReview {
    private String productName;
    private int rating;
    private String reviewText;
}
```

---

## **Instructions**
1. **Add getters and setters** in each class.
2. **In the first two classes (`Book`, `User`), getters and setters should simply return and set values.**
3. **In the other classes (`BankAccount`, `WeatherReport`, `ProductReview`), add validation in setters.**
4. Use **`this`** in setters to differentiate local variables from class fields.

  <summary><b>Lesson 24: OOP Principles. Inheritance</b></summary>

<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary>1. What is Inheritance?</summary>

## **What is Inheritance?**

### **Theoretical Foundations of Inheritance**

🔹 **Inheritance** is one of the four key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows **creating new classes based on existing ones**, reusing their properties and methods.

🔹 In Java, inheritance is implemented using the **`extends` keyword**. This means that a new class (child class) **inherits** functionality from a parent class while also being able to add its own unique methods and properties.

---

### **Why is Inheritance Important?**

🟢 **1. Reducing Code Duplication**  
Imagine you have multiple classes describing similar objects. Instead of copying the same code into each of them, you can extract **common properties and methods** into a parent class.

🟢 **2. Logical Grouping of Objects**  
Inheritance helps structure the code by creating a **class hierarchy**, making the program more readable and understandable.

🟢 **3. Easier Maintenance and Scalability**  
If you need to modify a common behavior, you can simply **change the code in the parent class**, and the update will automatically apply to all child classes.

🟢 **4. Ability to Override Behavior**  
A child class can **modify (override) the methods of the parent class** if it needs to function differently.

---

### **How Is Inheritance Used?**

Suppose we are developing a system for managing **smart devices**, such as smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches.  
All of these devices share **common characteristics** (screen, battery, processor) and **functions** (turning on/off).

**How can we describe them?**  
❌ **Without inheritance:** We would have to duplicate the code in each class.  
✔ **With inheritance:** We can create a **base class `SmartDevice`** and then extend it with  
`Smartphone`, `Tablet`, and `SmartWatch`.

---

### **Real-Life Analogy: Smart Devices**

📱 **Smartphones**, ⌚ **smartwatches**, and 💻 **tablets** are all **smart devices** that share **common properties**:

- **Screen**
- **Processor**
- **Operating system**
- **Battery charging capability**

However, each of them has **unique functions**:

- **Smartphone** – can make calls.
- **Tablet** – ideal for working with documents and drawing.
- **Smartwatch** – tracks physical activity.

We can create a **general `SmartDevice` class** and then extend it with **`Smartphone`**, **`Tablet`**, and **`SmartWatch`**, adding additional methods specific to each.

---

### **Conclusion**

✅ **Inheritance** helps eliminate code duplication and simplifies program maintenance.  
✅ **It helps group classes** into a logical structure.  
✅ **It simplifies functional expansion** – new devices can be added easily by inheriting from `SmartDevice`.  
✅ **It allows modifying general logic** in one place – a change in the parent class automatically affects all child classes.

<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary>2. Implementing Inheritance in Java</summary>

## **Implementing Inheritance in Java**

### **The `extends` Keyword: How to Create a Subclass**

🔹 In Java, inheritance is implemented using the **`extends` keyword**, which indicates that **a new class (child class) inherits functionality from a parent class**.  
🔹 The child class receives **all public and protected (`protected`) fields and methods** from the parent class.  
🔹 The child class can:  
✔ **Use** inherited properties and methods.  
✔ **Extend** the parent class with new properties and methods.  
✔ **Override** (modify) inherited methods if different behavior is needed.

**Basic inheritance syntax:**
```java
class ParentClass {
// Fields and methods of the parent class
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
// Additional properties and methods of the child class
}
```

---

### **Inheriting Fields and Methods from a Superclass**

Let's assume we have a **base class `SmartDevice`**, which defines the essential characteristics of smart devices.  
All **smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches** have **a brand, model, and basic power-on functionality**.

**Parent class `SmartDevice`:**
```java
class SmartDevice {
    String brand;
    String model;

    void powerOn() {
        System.out.println(model + " is turning on...");
    }
}
```
Now, we will create **child classes** that inherit this functionality and add their own features.

---

### **Example: `SmartDevice` and Its Subclasses (`Smartphone`, `Tablet`, `SmartWatch`)**

**1. Inheriting `Smartphone` from `SmartDevice`**  
A smartphone can **make calls**, while also inheriting all properties and methods of `SmartDevice`.

```java
class Smartphone extends SmartDevice {
    void makeCall(String number) {
        System.out.println("Calling " + number);
    }
}
```

**2. Inheriting `Tablet` from `SmartDevice`**  
A tablet inherits `SmartDevice` properties and adds a feature to draw on the screen.

```java
class Tablet extends SmartDevice {
    void drawOnScreen() {
        System.out.println("Drawing on the screen...");
    }
}
```

**3. Inheriting `SmartWatch` from `SmartDevice`**  
A smartwatch can display the time while also inheriting basic characteristics.

```java
class SmartWatch extends SmartDevice {
    void showTime() {
        System.out.println("Current time: 12:30");
    }
}
```

---

### **Using Inheritance in a Program**

Now, let's create objects of different devices and test their functionality.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Smartphone phone = new Smartphone();
        phone.brand = "Samsung";
        phone.model = "Galaxy S22";
        phone.powerOn(); // Method from the parent class
        phone.makeCall("+123456789"); // Method from the child class

        Tablet tablet = new Tablet();
        tablet.brand = "Apple";
        tablet.model = "iPad Pro";
        tablet.powerOn();
        tablet.drawOnScreen();

        SmartWatch watch = new SmartWatch();
        watch.brand = "Garmin";
        watch.model = "Forerunner 955";
        watch.powerOn();
        watch.showTime();
    }
}
```

**Console Output:**
```  
Galaxy S22 is turning on...  
Calling +123456789  
iPad Pro is turning on...  
Drawing on the screen...  
Forerunner 955 is turning on...  
Current time: 12:30  
```

---

### **Summary**
✅ **The `extends` keyword** allows creating child classes that inherit the properties and methods of a parent class.  
✅ **Objects of child classes can use inherited methods and add new ones.**  
✅ **The example with `SmartDevice`** demonstrated how to easily expand the functionality of a base class.

🚀 **Next, we will explore how to override inherited methods and use the `super` keyword!**

<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary>3. Multilevel Inheritance</summary>

## **Multilevel Inheritance**

### **What is Multilevel Inheritance?**

🔹 **Multilevel inheritance** is when **one subclass inherits from another**, creating a **chain of classes**.  
🔹 Each successive class **extends or modifies the functionality** of the previous one while inheriting all its properties and methods.  
🔹 Java allows **deep inheritance hierarchies**, but excessively long chains can make the code harder to manage.

---

### **When to Use Multilevel Inheritance?**

✅ When **classes are logically related** and extend each other's functionality.  
✅ When **code duplication needs to be minimized** by structuring classes properly.  
✅ When each level of inheritance **adds a new layer of functionality**.

❌ **Avoid multilevel inheritance** if simpler inheritance is sufficient. Deep hierarchies can make maintenance more difficult.

### **How `Smartphone` Can Inherit `MusicPlayer` and `Camera`**

Let’s consider an example with smart devices.  
A smartphone **can play music (MusicPlayer)** and **take photos (Camera)**.

However, Java **does not support multiple inheritance for classes**.  
Solution: **Use multilevel inheritance**, where:

- `MusicPlayer` – the base class that plays music.
- `Camera` extends `MusicPlayer` and adds photography functionality.
- `SmartDevice` extends `Camera` and contains common smart device functions.
- `Smartphone` extends `SmartDevice`, combining all features.

```
MusicPlayer → Camera → SmartDevice → Smartphone

```

---

### **Example: Multilevel Inheritance in Code**

#### **1. Base Class `MusicPlayer`**
This class handles music playback.

```java
class MusicPlayer {
    void playMusic() {
        System.out.println("Playing music...");
    }
}
```

---

#### **2. Class `Camera`, Inheriting from `MusicPlayer`**
Adds the ability to take photos while keeping music playback.

```java
class Camera extends MusicPlayer {
    void takePhoto() {
        System.out.println("Photo taken!");
    }
}
```

---

#### **3. Class `SmartDevice`, Inheriting from `Camera`**
Adds common properties of all smart devices.

```java
class SmartDevice extends Camera {
    String brand;
    String model;

    void powerOn() {
        System.out.println(model + " is turning on...");
    }
}
```

---

#### **4. Class `Smartphone`, Inheriting from `SmartDevice`**
The final class that combines all functionalities.

```java
class Smartphone extends SmartDevice {
    void makeCall(String number) {
        System.out.println("Calling " + number);
    }
}
```

---

### **Using Multilevel Inheritance**

Now, let's create a `Smartphone` object and test all the functions inherited from different classes.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Smartphone phone = new Smartphone();
        phone.brand = "Samsung";
        phone.model = "Galaxy S22";

        phone.powerOn();    // Method from SmartDevice
        phone.playMusic();  // Method from MusicPlayer
        phone.takePhoto();  // Method from Camera
        phone.makeCall("+123456789");  // Method from Smartphone
    }
}
```

**Console Output:**
```  
Galaxy S22 is turning on...  
Playing music...  
Photo taken!  
Calling +123456789  
```

---

### **Summary**
✅ **Multilevel inheritance** allows building **logical hierarchies**, where each class extends the previous one.  
✅ **The class chain** `MusicPlayer → Camera → SmartDevice → Smartphone` demonstrates how to combine functions in a single class.  
✅ **Each level adds new functionality**, making code reuse easier.

  <summary>4. Method Overriding and the `super` Keyword</summary>

## **Method Overriding and the `super` Keyword**

### **What is Method Overriding?**

🔹 **Overriding** is a process where **a child class changes the implementation of a method inherited from a parent class**.  
🔹 It is used when the method’s behavior in the parent class **is not suitable** for the child class.  
🔹 The method in the child class **must have the same name, parameters, and return type**, but with a different implementation.  
🔹 In Java, the `@Override` annotation is recommended (but not mandatory) when overriding a method.

**Example syntax:**
```java
class Parent {
    void showMessage() {
        System.out.println("Message from the parent class");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void showMessage() {
        System.out.println("Message from the child class");
    }
}
```

---

### **Using `super` to Call Parent Class Methods**

🔹 The **`super`** keyword allows a child class to **call a method from the parent class**, even if it has been overridden.  
🔹 `super` can be used **inside an overridden method** to preserve part of the parent class’s functionality.  
🔹 It can also be used in **constructors** to call the parent class’s constructor.

---

### **Example: Overriding `takePhoto()` in `Smartphone` While Keeping `Camera` Functionality**

In the previous example, the `Camera` class **can take photos**, but `Smartphone` should be able to **apply filters** when taking a picture.

We use **`super.takePhoto()`** to first execute the parent class’s method and then add new functionality.

#### **1. Parent Class `Camera`**
```java
class Camera {
    void takePhoto() {
        System.out.println("Photo taken!");
    }
}
```

---

#### **2. Child Class `Smartphone`, Overriding `takePhoto()`**
```java
class Smartphone extends Camera {
    @Override
    void takePhoto() {
        super.takePhoto(); // Calls the parent class's method
        System.out.println("Filter applied to the photo!");
    }
}
```

---

### **Using `super` in Constructors**

🔹 The **`super()`** keyword is used to call **a parent class constructor** from the child class.  
🔹 This is useful when the parent class **requires mandatory parameters** that need to be passed when creating an object.

#### **Example: `SmartDevice` with a Constructor**
```java
class SmartDevice {
    String brand;
    String model;

    SmartDevice(String brand, String model) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
    }
}
```
---

#### **Child Class `Smartphone`, Using `super()` in the Constructor**
```java
class Smartphone extends SmartDevice {
    Smartphone(String brand, String model) {
        super(brand, model); // Calls the parent class constructor
    }

    void showInfo() {
        System.out.println("Device: " + brand + " " + model);
    }
}
```

---

### **Using Overridden Methods and `super` in a Program**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Smartphone phone = new Smartphone("Apple", "iPhone 15");
        phone.showInfo(); // Displays device information

        phone.takePhoto(); // Overridden method with super call
    }
}
```

**Console Output:**
```  
Device: Apple iPhone 15  
Photo taken!  
Filter applied to the photo!  
```

---

### **Summary**
✅ **Methods can be overridden in a child class** if their logic needs to be modified.  
✅ **The `super` keyword** allows calling a **parent class method**, preserving its behavior.  
✅ **`super()` in constructors** helps pass parameters from a child class to a parent class.

  <summary>Task 1: Employee Management System</summary>

## **Task: Inheritance in a Corporate System**

🔹 In this task, you need to create a class hierarchy describing employees in a company.  
🔹 **Step 1:** Create a base class `Employee`, which will contain general characteristics.  
🔹 **Step 2:** Create subclasses `Manager`, `Developer`, and `Intern`, adding specific properties and methods.  
🔹 **Step 3:** Override the `work()` method in each subclass.

---

### **Step 1: Creating the Base Class `Employee`**
✔ Fields: `name` (employee name), `position` (job title), and `salary` (salary).  
✔ Method `work()`, which simply prints `"The employee is performing their duties."`.

---

### **Step 2: Creating Subclasses `Manager`, `Developer`, `Intern`**
✔ `Manager` – adds `teamSize` (number of team members) and a method `conductMeeting()`.  
✔ `Developer` – adds `programmingLanguage` (programming language).  
✔ `Intern` – adds `internshipDuration` (internship duration in months).

---

### **Step 3: Overriding the `work()` Method**
✔ `Manager`’s `work()` method prints `"The manager is leading the team and conducting meetings."`.  
✔ `Developer`’s `work()` method prints `"The developer is writing code in {programming_language}."`.  
✔ `Intern`’s `work()` method prints `"The intern is learning and assisting the team."`.

🚀 **Bonus:**  
✔ In `Manager`, use `super.work()` so that `"The employee is performing their duties."` is printed first, followed by `"The manager is leading the team."`.  
✔ Create multiple employee objects of different types and call `work()` on them.

✔ Method `applyDiscount()`, which prints `"No discount applied."`.

---

### **Step 2: Creating Subclasses `Electronics`, `Clothing`, `Grocery`**
✔ `Electronics` – adds `warranty` (warranty period in years).  
✔ `Clothing` – adds `size` (size) and `color` (color).  
✔ `Grocery` – adds `expirationDate` (expiration date).

---

### **Step 3: Overriding the `applyDiscount()` Method**
✔ `Electronics`’s `applyDiscount()` reduces the price by 10%.  
✔ `Clothing`’s `applyDiscount()` reduces the price by 20% if it's a sale season.  
✔ `Grocery`’s `applyDiscount()` reduces the price by 50% if the expiration date is approaching.

🚀 **Bonus:**  
✔ Use `super.applyDiscount()` so that the parent class method is called first.  
✔ Create an array of `Product[]`, add different product types, and apply discounts to them.

  <summary><b>Lesson 25: Polymorphism in Java</b></summary>

<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary><b>Polymorphism in a Messaging System</b></summary>

## **Polymorphism in a Messaging System**

Let's consider a situation where users can send messages in different ways:  
📱 **SMS** – sent via a mobile network.  
💬 **WhatsApp** – instant messaging over the internet.  
📧 **Email** – text messages sent through a mail server.

In all cases, a message **contains text, a sender, and a receiver**, but the delivery method differs.  
Here, we can apply **inheritance** and **polymorphism**.

---

## **Creating the Base Class `Message`**

We will start with a **base class `Message`**, which **stores common data**:  
✔ `text` – the message content.  
✔ `sender` – the sender of the message.  
✔ `receiver` – the recipient of the message.  
✔ Method `send()` – defines the sending process (to be overridden in subclasses).

This class does not need to know how the message will be sent – **this will be determined by subclasses**.

---

## **Extending `Message` with Specific Implementations**

Now, we will create three types of messages that inherit from `Message`:  
✔ **`SMSMessage`** – sent via a mobile network.  
✔ **`WhatsAppMessage`** – sent over the internet.  
✔ **`EmailMessage`** – sent via a mail server.

Each of these classes will **override the `send()` method** to implement its own unique way of sending a message.

---

## **Using Polymorphism to Work with Different Message Types**

When a user sends a message, **we don’t need to know what type it is**.  
We can work **through the general `Message` type**, but the actual behavior will depend on the specific object.

This way, **we can send an SMS, a WhatsApp message, or an Email using the same code**,  
without modifying the core logic of how messages are processed.

  <summary><b>Method Overloading (Compile-Time Polymorphism)</b></summary>

## **What is Method Overloading?**

🔹 **Method Overloading** is the ability to define multiple methods  
with the same name but different parameters within a class.

🔹 The compiler **distinguishes methods** based on the number, type,  
and order of parameters, so the method call is determined **at compile-time**.

---

## **Rules of Method Overloading**
✔ **Methods must differ in the number or type of parameters**.  
✔ **The return type does not affect overloading** (methods like `void print()` and `int print()` are considered the same).  
✔ **Overloaded methods can exist in the same class or a subclass**.

---

## **Example of Overloading in a Messaging System**

Let's say we have a `printDetails()` method in the `Message` class  
that prints message information.

🔹 We can overload this method so that it accepts **different parameters**:

1️⃣ **No arguments** – simply prints the message text.  
2️⃣ **With `boolean showSender`** – specifies whether to show the sender.  
3️⃣ **With `int maxLength`** – limits the number of displayed characters.

This way, we can call `printDetails()` in different contexts,  
and the compiler will choose the appropriate version **at compile-time**.

</details>

<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary><b>Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)</b></summary>

## **What is Method Overriding?**

🔹 **Method Overriding** is a mechanism where a **subclass provides its own implementation of a method**  
that is already defined in the parent class.

🔹 Unlike **method overloading**, overriding allows **modifying method behavior** without changing its signature.  
The decision on **which method version to execute is made at runtime**.

---

## **Difference Between Overloading and Overriding**

| **Feature**           | **Overloading**          | **Overriding**           |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **When does it occur?** | At compile-time  | At runtime |
| **Where is it defined?** | In the same class  | In parent and child classes |
| **Method signature** | Different parameters  | Same parameters |
| **Purpose**  | Extending method functionality  | Changing method behavior |

---

## **Example of Overriding in a Messaging System**

Previously, we created a base class `Message` with a `send()` method.  
Now, each specific implementation (`SMSMessage`, `WhatsAppMessage`, `EmailMessage`)  
must **override this method** to define its own sending logic.

### **How does overriding work in this case?**

1️⃣ **In the parent class `Message`**, we declare a `send()` method,  
but we don't know how exactly the message will be sent.

2️⃣ **In each subclass (`SMSMessage`, `WhatsAppMessage`, `EmailMessage`)**,  
we **override the `send()` method** so that it performs **its specific** sending action.

3️⃣ **When calling `send()` on a `Message` object** (e.g., `message.send()`),  
**the method from the actual object type will be executed**.

---

## **Implementation in Code**

```java
// Base class Message
class Message {
protected String text;
protected String sender;
protected String receiver;

    public Message(String text, String sender, String receiver) {
        this.text = text;
        this.sender = sender;
        this.receiver = receiver;
    }

    // The send() method will be overridden in subclasses
    public void send() {
        System.out.println("Sending message...");
    }
}
```

```java
// Subclass SMSMessage
class SMSMessage extends Message {
public SMSMessage(String text, String sender, String receiver) {
super(text, sender, receiver);
}

    @Override
    public void send() {
        System.out.println("Sending SMS: " + text + " from " + sender + " to " + receiver);
    }
}
```

```java
// Subclass WhatsAppMessage
class WhatsAppMessage extends Message {
public WhatsAppMessage(String text, String sender, String receiver) {
super(text, sender, receiver);
}

    @Override
    public void send() {
        System.out.println("Sending WhatsApp message: " + text + " from " + sender + " to " + receiver);
    }
}
```

```java
// Subclass EmailMessage
class EmailMessage extends Message {
public EmailMessage(String text, String sender, String receiver) {
super(text, sender, receiver);
}

    @Override
    public void send() {
        System.out.println("Sending Email: " + text + " from " + sender + " to " + receiver);
    }
}
```

### **Using Polymorphism in Code**

```java
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// Creating an array of different types of messages
Message[] messages = {
new SMSMessage("Hello!", "Anna", "John"),
new WhatsAppMessage("How are you?", "Maria", "Alex"),
new EmailMessage("Important letter", "Company", "Client")
};

        // Sending all messages using the common Message interface
        for (Message message : messages) {
            message.send();
        }
    }
}
```

### **Expected Console Output:**
```
Sending SMS: Hello! from Anna to John  
Sending WhatsApp message: How are you? from Maria to Alex  
Sending Email: Important letter from Company to Client  
```

---

## **Summary**

✅ **Method overriding** allows subclasses to modify the behavior of a parent class method.  
✅ **Runtime polymorphism** enables working with different objects through a common interface (`Message`).  
✅ **The messaging example** demonstrates how a single action (`send()`) can be implemented differently depending on the message type.

  <summary><b>Using Polymorphism in Practice</b></summary>

## **Superclass Variable Holding a Subclass Object**

One of the key advantages of polymorphism is the ability to declare **a superclass variable**  
and assign it **subclass objects**.

This allows us to **write generic code** that works with different objects **in the same way**,  
without being tied to a specific subclass.

**Example:**
🔹 We have a base class `Message` and three subclasses: `SMSMessage`, `WhatsAppMessage`, `EmailMessage`.  
🔹 We can declare a variable `Message msg`, but assign **any** of these subclasses to it.

```java
Message msg1 = new SMSMessage("Hello!", "Anna", "John");
Message msg2 = new WhatsAppMessage("How are you?", "Maria", "Alex");
Message msg3 = new EmailMessage("Important letter", "Company", "Client");
```

---

## **Polymorphism in Action: Dynamic Method Dispatch**

When a method is called on a superclass variable,  
**the actual method executed is determined at runtime**.

This is called **Dynamic Method Dispatch**.  
Java automatically determines **which `send()` method to execute**,  
based on the **actual type of the object**.

```java
msg1.send(); // Calls send() from SMSMessage
msg2.send(); // Calls send() from WhatsAppMessage
msg3.send(); // Calls send() from EmailMessage
```

### **How does it work?**
🔹 Java does not check the declared variable type (`Message`) but instead examines the **actual object type** stored in it.  
🔹 At runtime, **the system searches for the correct implementation** of the method in the actual subclass (`SMSMessage`, `WhatsAppMessage`, etc.).  
🔹 This allows handling different types of messages **in a unified way**.

---

## **Applying Polymorphism in Real Code**

Using **polymorphism**, we can, for example, create **a list of all messages**  
and send them **in a single loop**, even if they are of different types.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
// Creating an array of Message objects
        Message[] messages = {
                new SMSMessage("Hello!", "Anna", "John"),
                new WhatsAppMessage("How are you?", "Maria", "Alex"),
                new EmailMessage("Important letter", "Company", "Client")
        };

        // Sending all messages in a single loop
        for (Message message : messages) {
            message.send();
        }
    }
}
```

### **Expected Console Output:**
```
Sending SMS: Hello! from Anna to John  
Sending WhatsApp message: How are you? from Maria to Alex  
Sending Email: Important letter from Company to Client  
```

---

## **Summary**
✅ **Polymorphism allows declaring superclass variables and assigning subclass objects to them**.  
✅ **Dynamic method dispatch** ensures that the correct `send()` method is executed at runtime.  
✅ **Thanks to polymorphism**, we can handle different message types **in a unified way**, without redundant code.

  <summary><b>Classwork: Polymorphism in a Notification System</b></summary>

## **Task: Applying Polymorphism in a Notification System**

🔹 In this task, you will create a notification system that supports different delivery channels.  
🔹 **Step 1:** Implement a base class `Notification` with common properties and a `send()` method.  
🔹 **Step 2:** Create subclasses `PushNotification`, `EmailNotification`, and `SMSNotification`, overriding `send()`.  
🔹 **Step 3:** Use polymorphism to handle different notification types in a unified way.

---

### **Step 1: Create the Base Class `Notification`**
✔ Define fields for `message`, `recipient`, and `timestamp`.  
✔ Implement a method `send()`, which will later be overridden by subclasses.

---

### **Step 2: Create Subclasses for Different Notification Types**
✔ `PushNotification` – Implements `send()` to simulate sending a push notification.  
✔ `EmailNotification` – Implements `send()` to simulate sending an email notification.  
✔ `SMSNotification` – Implements `send()` to simulate sending an SMS notification.

Each subclass should **implement its own version of `send()`**.

---

### **Step 3: Use Polymorphism in the `Main` Class**
✔ Create an array or list of `Notification` objects, each holding a different type of notification.  
✔ Iterate through the collection and call `send()` on each notification.  
✔ Observe how Java dynamically calls the correct `send()` method depending on the object type.

  <summary><b>Урок 23: Принципы ООП. Инкапсуляция </b></summary>

<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary><b>1. Что такое инкапсуляция? </b></summary>

## **Что такое инкапсуляция?**

### **Определение и важность инкапсуляции**

🔹 **Инкапсуляция** – это один из ключевых принципов ООП, который означает **скрытие внутренних данных объекта** и *
*ограничение доступа к ним**.

Основные цели инкапсуляции:  
✔️ **Защита данных** – исключение прямого изменения важных полей объекта.  
✔️ **Контроль доступа** – изменение данных происходит только через методы.  
✔️ **Гибкость кода** – можно менять внутреннюю логику класса без влияния на остальной код.

**Пример без инкапсуляции (плохая практика):**

```java
class BankAccount {
    String owner;
    double balance;
}
```

Здесь **balance** открыт, и его можно изменить извне без ограничений:

```java
BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
account.balance =-1000; // Ошибка: можно установить отрицательный баланс!
```

Чтобы избежать таких проблем, используют **инкапсуляцию**.

### **Аналогия: Доступ к файлам на компьютере**

Представьте, что ваш компьютер — это **класс**, а файлы на нём имеют **разные уровни доступа**:

| **Модификатор** | **Аналогия в компьютере**                              | **Кто может открыть файл?**                |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `private`       | **Личные документы**                                   | Только владелец компьютера                 |
| `default`       | **Рабочие файлы в локальной сети**                     | Только коллеги в одной сети                |
| `protected`     | **Общий диск с паролем**                               | Доступен семье или избранным пользователям |
| `public`        | **Файл в интернете (Google Docs с открытым доступом)** | Любой пользователь сети                    |

🔹 **Примеры:**

- **`private`** – ваш личный дневник, который никто не может открыть без пароля.
- **`default`** – файлы в офисной сети, доступные только сотрудникам компании.
- **`protected`** – семейные фото в облаке, доступные только по паролю.
- **`public`** – открытая статья в интернете, доступная всем.

### **Защита данных с помощью модификаторов доступа**

В Java для инкапсуляции используются **модификаторы доступа**, которые контролируют, какие части кода могут
взаимодействовать с полями и методами объекта.

| **Модификатор** | **Доступен внутри класса** | **Доступен внутри пакета** | **Доступен в подклассах** | **Доступен в других классах** |
|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `private`       | ✅ Да                       | ❌ Нет                      | ❌ Нет                     | ❌ Нет                         |
| `default`       | ✅ Да                       | ✅ Да                       | ❌ Нет                     | ❌ Нет                         |
| `protected`     | ✅ Да                       | ✅ Да                       | ✅ Да                      | ❌ Нет                         |
| `public`        | ✅ Да                       | ✅ Да                       | ✅ Да                      | ✅ Да                          |

**Как правильно защитить данные?**  
✔️ Использовать `private` для полей (чтобы нельзя было изменить их напрямую).  
✔️ Доступ к данным делать через **геттеры и сеттеры**.  
✔️ Разрешать изменение данных только через методы с проверками.

Пример **инкапсуляции данных** в классе `BankAccount`:

```java
class BankAccount {
    private String owner;
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(String owner, double initialBalance) {
        this.owner = owner;
        if (initialBalance >= 0) {
            this.balance = initialBalance;
        } else {
            this.balance = 0;
            System.out.println("Баланс не может быть отрицательным. Установлено 0.");
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Баланс пополнен на " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Сумма для пополнения должна быть положительной.");
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Снято " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Недостаточно средств или некорректная сумма.");
        }
    }

}
```

Теперь нельзя просто так изменить `balance`:

```java
BankAccount account = new BankAccount("Alice", 500);
account.

deposit(200);
account.

withdraw(1000); // Ошибка: недостаточно средств
```

---

### **Аналогия из реального мира: банковский счёт**

Представьте, что у вас есть **банковский счёт**.

- Вы **не можете** просто так изменить баланс, написав `balance = 100000;`
- Баланс можно **увеличить** только через пополнение.
- Баланс можно **уменьшить** только через снятие.
- Нельзя уйти в минус, если банк не разрешает овердрафт.

🔹 **Класс `BankAccount` работает так же!** Он скрывает `balance` и даёт доступ к нему **только через методы**, которые
проверяют, можно ли выполнить операцию.

---

## **Вывод**

✅ **Инкапсуляция** защищает данные и контролирует доступ к ним.  
✅ Поля класса делают `private`, а доступ к ним организуют через методы.  
✅ **Аналогия** – банковский счёт: доступ к балансу возможен только через операции.

  <summary><b>2. Модификаторы доступа в Java </b></summary>

## **Модификаторы доступа в Java**

### **Что такое модификаторы доступа?**

🔹 **Модификаторы доступа** (Access Modifiers) – это ключевые слова в Java, которые определяют **уровень видимости и
доступности** классов, методов и полей внутри программы.

**Почему это важно?**  
✔️ Позволяют **контролировать доступ** к данным.  
✔️ Защищают **внутреннюю логику** класса от неправильного использования.  
✔️ Улучшают **структуру и читаемость кода**.

В Java есть **4 основных модификатора доступа**:

| **Модификатор**              | **Видимость в классе** | **Видимость в пакете** | **Видимость в подклассах** | **Видимость в других классах** |
|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `private`                    | ✅ Да                   | ❌ Нет                  | ❌ Нет                      | ❌ Нет                          |
| `default` (без модификатора) | ✅ Да                   | ✅ Да                   | ❌ Нет                      | ❌ Нет                          |
| `protected`                  | ✅ Да                   | ✅ Да                   | ✅ Да                       | ❌ Нет                          |
| `public`                     | ✅ Да                   | ✅ Да                   | ✅ Да                       | ✅ Да                           |

---

### **Разбор модификаторов с примерами**

#### **1. `private` – Полный контроль внутри класса**

🔹 **Доступен только внутри самого класса**.  
🔹 Полностью **скрывает данные** от других классов.  
🔹 Используется для **защиты важных данных**, например, пароля или баланса.

**Пример:**
```java
class User {
private String password;

    public User(String password) {
        this.password = password;
    }

    private void encryptPassword() { 
        System.out.println("Шифрование пароля...");
    }

}
```

**❌ Ошибка: нельзя получить доступ к `password` или вызвать `encryptPassword()` из другого класса.**

---

#### **2. `default` (package-private) – Доступ в рамках пакета**

🔹 **Доступен внутри того же пакета**, но **не доступен в других пакетах**.  
🔹 Если **не указан модификатор**, по умолчанию используется `default`.  
🔹 Полезен для классов, которые должны взаимодействовать внутри одного модуля.

**Пример:**
```java
class PackageClass {
    String message = "Доступен только в этом пакете!";
}
```

Если другой класс из **того же пакета** попытается обратиться к `message`, он сможет это сделать:  
```java
PackageClass obj = new PackageClass();
System.out.println(obj.message); // Работает!
```

Но если класс находится **в другом пакете**, он **не сможет получить доступ**.

---

#### **3. `protected` – Доступ в пакете + наследование**

🔹 Доступен **всем классам внутри пакета** + **наследникам в других пакетах**.  
🔹 Позволяет **защищённое наследование**: данные скрыты от всех, кроме дочерних классов.

**Пример:**
```java
class Parent {
    protected String familySecret = "Секрет семьи";
}
```

```java
class Child extends Parent {
    void revealSecret() {
        System.out.println(familySecret); // Работает!
    }
}
```

Если `Child` находится в **другом пакете**, но **наследуется от Parent**, то он сможет получить доступ к `protected`
-полю.

---

#### **4. `public` – Полный доступ отовсюду**

🔹 Доступен **в любом классе и любом пакете**.  
🔹 Используется для **открытых API и интерфейсов**, которые должны быть доступны всем.

**Пример:**
```java
public class PublicClass {
    public String greeting = "Привет, мир!";
}
```

Любой код может получить доступ к `greeting`:  
```java
PublicClass obj = new PublicClass();
System.out.println(obj.greeting); // Работает!
```

---

### **Когда и зачем использовать каждый модификатор?**

| **Модификатор** | **Когда использовать?**                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `private`       | Для **скрытых данных**, например, паролей, баланса, внутренних методов. |
| `default`       | Если класс или метод **не должен быть виден за пределами пакета**.      |
| `protected`     | Если нужно **разрешить доступ подклассам**, но скрыть от остальных.     |
| `public`        | Если **метод или класс должен быть доступен всем** (например, API).     |

---

## **Вывод**

✅ **Модификаторы доступа** управляют видимостью данных в Java.  
✅ **`private`** защищает данные внутри класса.  
✅ **`default`** работает только в рамках одного пакета.  
✅ **`protected`** доступен наследникам, даже если они в другом пакете.  
✅ **`public`** позволяет использовать класс и его методы везде.

  <summary>4. Практика</summary>

### **Задание: Выбрать правильные модификаторы доступа**

Ниже представлены несколько классов с полями, у которых **пока нет модификаторов доступа**.  
Ваша задача — **назначить правильные модификаторы (`public`, `private`, `protected`)**, следуя принципам инкапсуляции.

---

```java
// TODO: Назначить модификаторы доступа для полей в соответствии с принципами инкапсуляции.

class UserAccount {
    String username;
    String password;
    String email;
    int age;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Назначить модификаторы доступа для полей.

class BankAccount {
    String accountNumber;
    double balance;
    String ownerName;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Назначить модификаторы доступа для полей.

class Product {
    String name;
    double price;
    int stock;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Назначить модификаторы доступа для полей.

class Car {
    String brand;
    String model;
    int speed;
    double fuelLevel;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Назначить модификаторы доступа для полей.

class LibraryBook {
    String title;
    String author;
    boolean isAvailable;
    String borrowerName;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Назначить модификаторы доступа для полей.

class Order {
    int orderId;
    String customerName;
    double totalAmount;
    String status;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Назначить модификаторы доступа для полей.

class Flight {
    String flightNumber;
    String destination;
    int availableSeats;
    String departureTime;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Назначить модификаторы доступа для полей.

class ChatMessage {
    String sender;
    String receiver;
    String text;
    String timestamp;
}
```

---

### **Инструкции:**

1. Просмотрите поля в каждом классе и решите, какие из них должны быть **`private`**, **`protected`** или **`public`**.
2. Подумайте, **какие поля следует скрыть (private)**, а какие оставить доступными.
3. Отредактируйте классы, добавив модификаторы доступа.

🚀 **Это упражнение поможет вам понять, как правильно инкапсулировать данные в Java!**
</details>
</details>

<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary><b>3. Геттеры, сеттеры и ключевое слово `this`</b></summary>

## **Геттеры и сеттеры в Java**

### **Почему прямой доступ к полям — плохая практика?**

🔹 **Прямой доступ к полям (`public`) нарушает инкапсуляцию** и позволяет неконтролируемо изменять данные.  
🔹 Если поля открыты, **любой класс может изменить их без ограничений**, что может привести к ошибкам.  
🔹 Геттеры и сеттеры **позволяют контролировать** изменение значений, добавляя валидацию.

**Пример плохой практики (без инкапсуляции):**  
```java
class BankAccount {
public double balance;
}
```

В этом случае любой класс может изменить `balance` без проверки:  
```java
BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
account.balance = -1000; // ❌ Ошибка! Баланс не может быть отрицательным.
```

Чтобы избежать подобных проблем, **используют геттеры и сеттеры**.

---

### **Реализация геттеров и сеттеров**

🔹 **Геттер (`get`)** – метод, который позволяет **прочитать значение** приватного поля.  
🔹 **Сеттер (`set`)** – метод, который **изменяет значение** с проверкой.

#### **Использование `this` в сеттерах**
🔹 Внутри сеттера часто используется **`this`**, чтобы различать локальную переменную и поле класса, если они имеют одинаковые имена.

**Пример: правильная реализация с использованием геттеров, сеттеров и `this`**  
```java
class BankAccount {
private double balance;

    public double getBalance() { // Геттер
        return balance;
    }

    public void setBalance(double balance) { // Сеттер
        if (balance >= 0) {
            this.balance = balance; // `this.balance` указывает на поле класса, `balance` — локальная переменная.
        } else {
            System.out.println("❌ Баланс не может быть отрицательным!");
        }
    }
}
```

Теперь внешний код **не может** напрямую изменить `balance`, а может использовать `setBalance()` с проверкой.

**Использование:**  
```java
BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
account.setBalance(500);  // ✅ Корректно
account.setBalance(-100); // ❌ Выведет "Баланс не может быть отрицательным!"
System.out.println(account.getBalance()); // Выведет 500
```

---

### **Пример: `BankAccount` с контролируемым изменением баланса**

Более сложный пример, где также добавлены методы `deposit()` и `withdraw()`, использующие `this`.

```java
class BankAccount {
private double balance;

    public BankAccount(double balance) {
        if (balance >= 0) {
            this.balance = balance; // Используем `this` для явного указания на поле класса
        } else {
            System.out.println("❌ Начальный баланс не может быть отрицательным. Установлен 0.");
            this.balance = 0;
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() { // Геттер
        return this.balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            this.balance += amount;
            System.out.println("✅ Баланс пополнен на " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("❌ Сумма пополнения должна быть положительной.");
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= this.balance) {
            this.balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("✅ Снято: " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("❌ Недостаточно средств или некорректная сумма.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Использование:**  
```java
BankAccount account = new BankAccount(100);
account.deposit(50);
account.withdraw(200); // ❌ Недостаточно средств
System.out.println("Баланс: " + account.getBalance()); // ✅ 150
```

---

## **Что такое `this` и зачем он нужен?**

🔹 `this` – это **ссылка на текущий объект класса**, позволяющая:  
✔️ Различать локальные переменные и поля класса (например, `this.balance = balance`).  
✔️ Передавать текущий объект в методы других классов.  
✔️ Вызывать один конструктор внутри другого (`this(...)`).

**Пример: использование `this` в конструкторах**  
```java
class User {
private String username;
private int age;

    // Конструктор с двумя параметрами
    public User(String username, int age) {
        this.username = username;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Конструктор по умолчанию вызывает другой конструктор через `this`
    public User() {
        this("Unknown", 18); // Вызывает другой конструктор
    }

    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Username: " + this.username + ", Age: " + this.age);
    }
}
```

**Использование:**  
```java
User user1 = new User("Alice", 25);
User user2 = new User(); // Будет использован конструктор по умолчанию

user1.displayInfo(); // ✅ Username: Alice, Age: 25
user2.displayInfo(); // ✅ Username: Unknown, Age: 18
```

---

## **Вывод**
✅ **Геттеры** позволяют безопасно получать значения приватных полей.  
✅ **Сеттеры** проверяют данные перед изменением полей.  
✅ **`this`** используется для явного указания на поля класса и вызова конструкторов.  
✅ Инкапсуляция защищает **данные от некорректных изменений**, уменьшая вероятность ошибок.

🚀 **Далее перейдём к практике, где будем реализовывать геттеры, сеттеры и `this` в разных классах!**

  <summary><b>4. Практика: Геттеры, сеттеры и `this`</b></summary>

## **Задание: Реализовать геттеры и сеттеры**

### **Цель упражнения**
✔️ Научиться использовать **геттеры и сеттеры** для доступа к приватным полям.  
✔️ Понять, как **валидация** в сеттерах помогает защищать данные.  
✔️ Освоить применение **ключевого слова `this`** для различения локальных переменных и полей класса.

---

### **Часть 1: Простые геттеры и сеттеры**
🔹 В первых двух классах вам нужно **просто реализовать геттеры и сеттеры** без валидации.

```java
// TODO: Добавить геттеры и сеттеры для всех полей.
class Book {
    private String title;
    private String author;
    private int pages;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Добавить геттеры и сеттеры для всех полей.
class User {
    private String username;
    private String email;
    private int age;
}
```

---

### **Часть 2: Геттеры, сеттеры и валидация**
🔹 В следующих классах вам нужно **реализовать геттеры и сеттеры** с **валидацией значений**.

---

```java
// TODO: Реализовать геттеры и сеттеры с валидацией.
// 1. Поле `balance` не может быть отрицательным.
// 2. Поле `accountNumber` нельзя менять после создания объекта.
class BankAccount {
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Реализовать геттеры и сеттеры с валидацией.
// 1. Поле `temperature` должно быть в диапазоне от -100 до 100 градусов.
// 2. Поле `condition` может быть только "Sunny", "Rainy", "Cloudy" или "Snowy".
class WeatherReport {
    private double temperature;
    private String condition;
}
```

---

```java
// TODO: Реализовать геттеры и сеттеры с валидацией.
// 1. Поле `rating` должно быть от 1 до 5.
// 2. Поле `reviewText` не должно быть пустым.
class ProductReview {
    private String productName;
    private int rating;
    private String reviewText;
}
```

---

## **Инструкции**
1. **Добавьте геттеры и сеттеры** в каждый класс.
2. **В первых двух классах (`Book`, `User`) геттеры и сеттеры должны просто возвращать и устанавливать значения.**
3. **В остальных классах (`BankAccount`, `WeatherReport`, `ProductReview`) добавьте валидацию в сеттерах.**
4. Используйте **`this`** в сеттерах, чтобы отличать локальные переменные от полей класса.

  <summary><b>Урок 24: Принцыпы ООП. Наследование</b></summary>

<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary>1. Что такое наследование?</summary>

## **Что такое наследование?**

### **Теоретические основы наследования**

🔹 **Наследование** – это один из четырех ключевых принципов объектно-ориентированного программирования (ООП). Оно
позволяет **создавать новые классы на основе уже существующих**, используя их свойства и методы.

🔹 В Java наследование реализуется с помощью **ключевого слова `extends`**. Это означает, что новый класс (дочерний) *
*унаследует** функциональность родительского класса, но при этом может добавлять свои уникальные методы и свойства.

---

### **Зачем нужно наследование?**

🟢 **1. Уменьшение дублирования кода**  
Представьте, что у вас есть несколько классов, описывающих похожие объекты. Вместо того чтобы копировать один и тот же
код в каждый из них, можно вынести **общие свойства и методы** в родительский класс.

🟢 **2. Логическая группировка объектов**  
Наследование помогает структурировать код, создавая **иерархию классов**. Это делает программу более читаемой и
понятной.

🟢 **3. Упрощение поддержки и масштабируемости**  
Если нужно изменить какую-то общую логику, достаточно **изменить код в родительском классе**, и это автоматически
отразится на всех дочерних классах.

🟢 **4. Возможность переопределять поведение**  
Дочерний класс может **изменять (переопределять) методы родителя**, если ему нужно работать по-другому.

---

### **Как используется наследование?**

Допустим, мы разрабатываем систему для управления **умными устройствами**: смартфонами, планшетами, умными часами.  
У всех этих устройств есть **общие характеристики** (экран, батарея, процессор) и **функции** (включение, выключение).

**Как мы можем их описать?**  
❌ **Без наследования:** придётся дублировать код в каждом классе.  
✔ **С наследованием:** можно создать **базовый класс `SmartDevice`**, а затем наследовать от
него `Smartphone`, `Tablet`, `SmartWatch`.

---

### **Аналогия из реальной жизни: умные устройства**

📱 **Смартфон**, ⌚ **умные часы** и 💻 **планшет** – это все **умные устройства**, у которых есть **общие свойства**:

- **Экран**
- **Процессор**
- **Операционная система**
- **Возможность заряжаться**

Но у каждого есть **свои уникальные функции**:

- **Смартфон** – умеет звонить.
- **Планшет** – удобен для работы с документами и рисования.
- **Умные часы** – отслеживают физическую активность.

Мы можем создать **общий класс `SmartDevice`**, а затем наследовать от него **`Smartphone`**, **`Tablet`** и *
*`SmartWatch`**, добавляя им дополнительные методы.

---

### **Вывод**

✅ **Наследование** позволяет избежать дублирования кода и упрощает поддержку программы.  
✅ **Помогает группировать классы** в логичную структуру.  
✅ **Упрощает расширение функционала** – новые устройства можно добавлять легко, просто унаследовав их
от `SmartDevice`.  
✅ **Позволяет изменять общую логику** в одном месте – достаточно поменять родительский класс, и это отразится на всех
его потомках.

<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary>2. Реализация наследования в Java</summary>

## **Реализация наследования в Java**

### **Ключевое слово `extends`: как создать подкласс**

🔹 В Java наследование реализуется с помощью **ключевого слова `extends`**, которое указывает, что **новый класс (дочерний) наследует функциональность родительского класса**.  
🔹 Дочерний класс получает **все публичные и защищённые (`protected`) поля и методы родительского класса**.  
🔹 Дочерний класс может:  
✔ **Использовать** унаследованные свойства и методы.  
✔ **Дополнять** родительский класс новыми свойствами и методами.  
✔ **Переопределять** (изменять) унаследованные методы, если требуется другая логика.

**Общий синтаксис наследования:**
```java
class ParentClass {
// Поля и методы родительского класса
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
// Дополнительные свойства и методы дочернего класса
}
```

---

### **Наследование полей и методов от суперкласса**

Предположим, у нас есть **базовый класс `SmartDevice`**, который описывает основные характеристики умных устройств.  
Все **смартфоны, планшеты и умные часы** имеют **бренд, модель и базовую функцию включения**.

**Родительский класс `SmartDevice`:**
```java
class SmartDevice {
    String brand;
    String model;

    void powerOn() {
        System.out.println(model + " включается...");
    }
}
```
Теперь создадим **дочерние классы**, которые унаследуют этот функционал и добавят свои особенности.

---

### **Пример: `SmartDevice` и его подклассы (`Smartphone`, `Tablet`, `SmartWatch`)**

**1. Наследуем `Smartphone` от `SmartDevice`**  
Смартфон умеет **звонить**, но также наследует все свойства и методы `SmartDevice`.

```java
class Smartphone extends SmartDevice {
    void makeCall(String number) {
        System.out.println("Звоним на " + number);
    }
}
```

**2. Наследуем `Tablet` от `SmartDevice`**  
Планшет получает свойства `SmartDevice` и добавляет возможность рисовать на экране.

```java
class Tablet extends SmartDevice {
    void drawOnScreen() {
        System.out.println("Рисуем на экране...");
    }
}
```

**3. Наследуем `SmartWatch` от `SmartDevice`**  
Умные часы могут показывать время и также наследуют базовые характеристики.

```java
class SmartWatch extends SmartDevice {
    void showTime() {
        System.out.println("Текущее время: 12:30");
    }
}
```

---

### **Использование наследования в программе**

Теперь создадим объекты разных устройств и проверим их работу.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Smartphone phone = new Smartphone();
        phone.brand = "Samsung";
        phone.model = "Galaxy S22";
        phone.powerOn(); // Метод из родительского класса
        phone.makeCall("+123456789"); // Метод из дочернего класса

        Tablet tablet = new Tablet();
        tablet.brand = "Apple";
        tablet.model = "iPad Pro";
        tablet.powerOn();
        tablet.drawOnScreen();

        SmartWatch watch = new SmartWatch();
        watch.brand = "Garmin";
        watch.model = "Forerunner 955";
        watch.powerOn();
        watch.showTime();
    }
}
```

**Вывод в консоль:**
```  
Galaxy S22 включается...  
Звоним на +123456789  
iPad Pro включается...  
Рисуем на экране...  
Forerunner 955 включается...  
Текущее время: 12:30  
```

---

### **Вывод**

  <summary>3. Последовательное наследование (многоуровневое)</summary>

## **Последовательное наследование (многоуровневое)**

### **Что такое многоуровневое наследование?**

🔹 **Многоуровневое наследование** — это процесс, когда **один подкласс наследуется от другого**, создавая **цепочку классов**.  
🔹 Каждый следующий класс **дополняет или изменяет функциональность** предыдущего, при этом наследуя все его свойства и методы.  
🔹 В Java можно строить **глубокую иерархию наследования**, но излишне длинные цепочки могут усложнить код.

---

### **Когда использовать многоуровневое наследование?**

✅ Когда **классы логически связаны** и расширяют функциональность друг друга.  
✅ Когда **нужно избежать дублирования кода** и структурировать классы.  
✅ Когда каждый уровень наследования **добавляет новый слой функциональности**.

❌ **Не стоит использовать** многоуровневое наследование, если можно обойтись простым наследованием. Глубокие иерархии могут усложнить поддержку кода.

---

### **Как `Smartphone` может унаследовать `MusicPlayer` и `Camera`**

Рассмотрим пример с умными устройствами.  
Смартфон **может воспроизводить музыку (MusicPlayer)** и **делать фотографии (Camera)**.

Но в Java **нельзя наследоваться сразу от двух классов**.  
Решение: **создать последовательное наследование**, где:

- `MusicPlayer` – базовый класс, который умеет воспроизводить музыку.
- `Camera` наследуется от `MusicPlayer` и добавляет функцию фотографирования.
- `SmartDevice` наследуется от `Camera` и содержит базовые функции устройства.
- `Smartphone` наследуется от `SmartDevice`, объединяя всё.

Получается следующая цепочка:

```text
MusicPlayer → Camera → SmartDevice → Smartphone
```

---

### **Пример: многоуровневое наследование в коде**

#### **1. Базовый класс `MusicPlayer`**
Этот класс умеет воспроизводить музыку.

```java
class MusicPlayer {
    void playMusic() {
        System.out.println("Воспроизведение музыки...");
    }
}
```

---

#### **2. Класс `Camera`, наследуется от `MusicPlayer`**
Добавляет возможность фотографирования, сохраняя возможность проигрывания музыки.

```java
class Camera extends MusicPlayer {
    void takePhoto() {
        System.out.println("Снимок сделан!");
    }
}
```

---

#### **3. Класс `SmartDevice`, наследуется от `Camera`**
Добавляет общие свойства всех умных устройств.

```java
class SmartDevice extends Camera {
    String brand;
    String model;

    void powerOn() {
        System.out.println(model + " включается...");
    }
}
```

---

#### **4. Класс `Smartphone`, наследуется от `SmartDevice`**
Финальный класс, объединяющий все функции.

```java
class Smartphone extends SmartDevice {
    void makeCall(String number) {
        System.out.println("Звоним на " + number);
    }
}
```

---

### **Использование многоуровневого наследования**

Теперь создадим объект `Smartphone` и протестируем все функции, унаследованные от разных классов.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Smartphone phone = new Smartphone();
        phone.brand = "Samsung";
        phone.model = "Galaxy S22";

        phone.powerOn();    // Метод из SmartDevice
        phone.playMusic();  // Метод из MusicPlayer
        phone.takePhoto();  // Метод из Camera
        phone.makeCall("+123456789");  // Метод из Smartphone
    }
}
```

**Вывод в консоль:**
```  
Galaxy S22 включается...  
Воспроизведение музыки...  
Снимок сделан!  
Звоним на +123456789  
```

---

### **Вывод**
✅ **Многоуровневое наследование** позволяет строить **логичные иерархии**, где каждый класс расширяет предыдущий.  
✅ **Цепочка классов** `MusicPlayer → Camera → SmartDevice → Smartphone` показала, как объединить функции в одном классе.  
✅ **Каждый уровень добавляет новую функциональность**, упрощая повторное использование кода.

🚀 **Далее разберём, как переопределять методы с помощью `super`!**
</details>

-------

<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary>4. Переопределение методов и ключевое слово `super`</summary>

## **Переопределение методов и ключевое слово `super`**

### **Что такое переопределение методов?**

🔹 **Переопределение (overriding)** – это процесс, при котором **дочерний класс изменяет реализацию метода, унаследованного от родительского класса**.  
🔹 Используется, когда поведение метода в родительском классе **не подходит** для дочернего класса.  
🔹 Метод в дочернем классе **должен иметь такое же имя, параметры и возвращаемый тип**, но свою реализацию.  
🔹 В Java для переопределения метода используется аннотация `@Override` (рекомендуется, но не обязательна).

**Пример синтаксиса:**
```java
class Parent {
    void showMessage() {
        System.out.println("Сообщение из родительского класса");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void showMessage() {
        System.out.println("Сообщение из дочернего класса");
    }
}
```

---

### **Использование `super` для вызова методов родительского класса**

🔹 Ключевое слово **`super`** позволяет дочернему классу **вызывать метод родительского класса**, даже если он был переопределён.  
🔹 `super` можно использовать **внутри переопределённого метода**, чтобы сохранить часть функционала родительского метода.  
🔹 Также `super` можно применять в **конструкторах** для вызова конструктора родительского класса.

---

### **Пример: переопределение метода `takePhoto()` в `Smartphone`, сохраняя функциональность `Camera`**

В предыдущем примере класс `Camera` умеет **делать снимки**, но `Smartphone` может **использовать фильтры при фотографировании**.

Используем **`super.takePhoto()`**, чтобы сначала выполнить действие родительского класса, а затем добавить новый функционал.

#### **1. Родительский класс `Camera`**
```java
class Camera {
    void takePhoto() {
        System.out.println("Фото сделано!");
    }
}
```

---

#### **2. Дочерний класс `Smartphone`, переопределяющий `takePhoto()`**
```java
class Smartphone extends Camera {
    @Override
    void takePhoto() {
        super.takePhoto(); // Вызов метода родительского класса
        System.out.println("Фильтр применён к фото!");
    }
}
```

---

### **Использование `super` в конструкторах**

🔹 Ключевое слово **`super()`** используется для вызова **конструктора родительского класса**.  
🔹 Это полезно, когда в родительском классе **есть обязательные параметры**, которые нужно передать при создании объекта.

#### **Пример: `SmartDevice` с конструктором**
```java
class SmartDevice {
    String brand;
    String model;

    SmartDevice(String brand, String model) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
    }
}
```
---

#### **Дочерний класс `Smartphone`, использующий `super()` в конструкторе**
```java
class Smartphone extends SmartDevice {
    Smartphone(String brand, String model) {
        super(brand, model); // Вызов конструктора родительского класса
    }

    void showInfo() {
        System.out.println("Устройство: " + brand + " " + model);
    }
}
```

---

### **Использование переопределённых методов и `super` в программе**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Smartphone phone = new Smartphone("Apple", "iPhone 15");
        phone.showInfo(); // Вывод информации об устройстве

        phone.takePhoto(); // Переопределённый метод с вызовом super
    }
}
```

**Вывод в консоль:**
```  
Устройство: Apple iPhone 15  
Фото сделано!  
Фильтр применён к фото!  
```

---

### **Вывод**
✅ **Методы можно переопределять в дочернем классе**, если требуется изменить их логику.  
✅ **Ключевое слово `super`** позволяет **вызвать родительский метод**, сохраняя его поведение.  
✅ **`super()` в конструкторах** помогает передавать параметры из дочернего класса в родительский.

🚀 **Далее разберём практические задания на наследование!**
</details>

---------

<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary>5. Практика</summary>

## **Практическое задание по наследованию**

### **Задача: Реализация цепочки наследования для умных устройств**

🔹 В этом задании вам нужно построить **иерархию классов**, используя наследование.  
🔹 **Шаг 1:** Создать базовый класс `SmartDevice` и унаследовать от него `Smartphone`, `Tablet` и `SmartWatch`.  
🔹 **Шаг 2:** Реализовать **цепочку наследования**, сначала расширяя `MusicPlayer`, затем `Camera`, а затем `SmartDevice`.  
🔹 **Шаг 3:** Использовать **`super`** для вызова методов и конструкторов родительского класса.

---

### **Шаг 1: Создание базового класса `SmartDevice`**
🔹 Базовый класс `SmartDevice` должен содержать:  
✔ Поля `brand` (бренд) и `model` (модель).  
✔ Метод `powerOn()`, который выводит `"Устройство включается..."`.

```java
class SmartDevice {
    String brand;
    String model;

    SmartDevice(String brand, String model) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
    }

    void powerOn() {
        System.out.println(model + " включается...");
    }
}
```

---

### **Шаг 2: Создание подклассов `Smartphone`, `Tablet`, `SmartWatch`**
🔹 Каждый подкласс наследуется от `SmartDevice` и добавляет уникальный метод:  
✔ `Smartphone` – `makeCall(String number)`.  
✔ `Tablet` – `drawOnScreen()`.  
✔ `SmartWatch` – `showTime()`.

```java
class Smartphone extends SmartDevice {
    Smartphone(String brand, String model) {
        super(brand, model);
    }

    void makeCall(String number) {
        System.out.println("Звоним на " + number);
    }
}

class Tablet extends SmartDevice {
    Tablet(String brand, String model) {
        super(brand, model);
    }

    void drawOnScreen() {
        System.out.println("Рисуем на экране...");
    }
}

class SmartWatch extends SmartDevice {
    SmartWatch(String brand, String model) {
        super(brand, model);
    }

    void showTime() {
        System.out.println("Текущее время: 12:30");
    }
}
```

---

### **Шаг 3: Реализация цепочки наследования**
🔹 Теперь создадим **цепочку наследования**, начиная с `MusicPlayer`.

#### **1. Класс `MusicPlayer` – базовый класс**
🔹 Содержит метод `playMusic()`.

```java
class MusicPlayer {
    void playMusic() {
        System.out.println("Воспроизведение музыки...");
    }
}
```

---

#### **2. Класс `Camera`, наследуется от `MusicPlayer`**
🔹 Добавляет метод `takePhoto()`.

```java
class Camera extends MusicPlayer {
    void takePhoto() {
        System.out.println("Снимок сделан!");
    }
}
```

---

#### **3. Класс `SmartDevice`, наследуется от `Camera`**
🔹 Теперь `SmartDevice` получает **музыкальный плеер и камеру**.

```java
class SmartDevice extends Camera {
    String brand;
    String model;

    SmartDevice(String brand, String model) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
    }

    void powerOn() {
        System.out.println(model + " включается...");
    }
}
```

---

#### **4. Класс `Smartphone`, наследуется от `SmartDevice`**
🔹 Теперь `Smartphone` умеет **играть музыку, делать снимки, включаться и звонить**.

```java
class Smartphone extends SmartDevice {
    Smartphone(String brand, String model) {
        super(brand, model);
    }

    void makeCall(String number) {
        System.out.println("Звоним на " + number);
    }

    @Override
    void takePhoto() {
        super.takePhoto();
        System.out.println("Фильтр применён к фото!");
    }
}
```

---

### **Шаг 4: Тестирование наследования**
Создадим объекты и протестируем, как работают все унаследованные методы.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Smartphone phone = new Smartphone("Samsung", "Galaxy S22");
        phone.powerOn();
        phone.playMusic();
        phone.takePhoto();
        phone.makeCall("+123456789");

        Tablet tablet = new Tablet("Apple", "iPad Pro");
        tablet.powerOn();
        tablet.drawOnScreen();

        SmartWatch watch = new SmartWatch("Garmin", "Forerunner 955");
        watch.powerOn();
        watch.showTime();
    }
}
```

**Ожидаемый вывод в консоль:**
```  
Galaxy S22 включается...  
Воспроизведение музыки...  
Снимок сделан!  
Фильтр применён к фото!  
Звоним на +123456789  
iPad Pro включается...  
Рисуем на экране...  
Forerunner 955 включается...  
Текущее время: 12:30  
```

---

### **Вывод**
✅ **Наследование помогает строить логичные иерархии**, объединяя связанные классы.  
✅ **Цепочка классов `MusicPlayer → Camera → SmartDevice → Smartphone`** показывает, как можно последовательно расширять функциональность.  
✅ **Использование `super`** позволяет вызывать методы родительского класса и добавлять новое поведение.


<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary>Задание 1: Система управления сотрудниками</summary>

## **Задание: Наследование в корпоративной системе**

🔹 В этом задании вам нужно создать иерархию классов, описывающих сотрудников компании.  
🔹 **Шаг 1:** Создать базовый класс `Employee`, который будет содержать общие характеристики.  
🔹 **Шаг 2:** Создать подклассы `Manager`, `Developer` и `Intern`, добавляя специфические свойства и методы.  
🔹 **Шаг 3:** Переопределить метод `work()` в каждом подклассе.

---

### **Шаг 1: Создание базового класса `Employee`**
✔ Поля `name` (имя), `position` (должность) и `salary` (зарплата).  
✔ Метод `work()`, который просто выводит `"Работник выполняет свои обязанности."`.

---

### **Шаг 2: Создание подклассов `Manager`, `Developer`, `Intern`**
✔ `Manager` – добавляет `teamSize` (размер команды) и метод `conductMeeting()`.  
✔ `Developer` – добавляет `programmingLanguage` (язык программирования).  
✔ `Intern` – добавляет `internshipDuration` (продолжительность стажировки).

---

### **Шаг 3: Переопределение метода `work()`**
✔ У `Manager` метод `work()` выводит `"Менеджер управляет командой и проводит встречи."`.  
✔ У `Developer` метод `work()` выводит `"Разработчик пишет код на {язык_программирования}."`.  
✔ У `Intern` метод `work()` выводит `"Стажёр учится и помогает команде."`.

🚀 **Дополнительно:**  
✔ В `Manager` использовать `super.work()`, чтобы сначала выводилось `"Работник выполняет свои обязанности."`, а затем добавлялось `"Менеджер управляет командой."`.  
✔ Создать несколько объектов разных типов сотрудников и вызвать у них `work()`.

  <summary><b>Урок 25: Полиморфизм в Java</b></summary>


<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary><b>Полиморфизм на примере системы сообщений</b></summary>

## **Полиморфизм на примере системы сообщений**

Рассмотрим ситуацию, в которой пользователи могут отправлять сообщения разными способами:  
📱 **SMS** – отправка через мобильную сеть.  
💬 **WhatsApp** – мгновенные сообщения через интернет.  
📧 **Email** – текстовое сообщение, отправляемое через почтовый сервер.

Во всех случаях сообщение **содержит текст, отправителя и получателя**, но способ доставки отличается.  
Здесь мы можем применить **наследование** и **полиморфизм**.

---

## **Создаём базовый класс `Message`**

Мы начнем с **базового класса `Message`**, который **содержит общие данные**:  
✔ `text` – сам текст сообщения.  
✔ `sender` – отправитель.  
✔ `receiver` – получатель.  
✔ Метод `send()` – определяет процесс отправки (будет переопределён в подклассах).

Этот класс не будет знать, каким образом сообщение будет отправлено – **это решат подклассы**.

---

## **Расширяем `Message` конкретными реализациями**

Теперь создадим три типа сообщений, которые наследуются от `Message`:  
✔ **`SMSMessage`** – отправка через мобильную сеть.  
✔ **`WhatsAppMessage`** – отправка через интернет.  
✔ **`EmailMessage`** – отправка через почтовый сервер.

Каждый из этих классов **переопределит метод `send()`** так, чтобы он соответствовал конкретному типу отправки.

---

## **Используем полиморфизм для работы с разными типами сообщений**

Когда пользователь отправляет сообщение, **нам не нужно знать, какой это тип сообщения**.  
Мы можем работать **через общий тип `Message`**, но реализация будет зависеть от того,  
какой именно объект мы передали.

Таким образом, **в одном и том же коде мы сможем отправлять SMS, WhatsApp или Email**,  
не изменяя сам механизм работы с сообщениями.

</details>

-------

<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary><b>Перегрузка методов (полиморфизм времени компиляции)</b></summary>

## **Что такое перегрузка методов?**

🔹 **Перегрузка методов (Method Overloading)** – это возможность объявлять в одном классе несколько методов  
с одинаковым именем, но разными параметрами.

🔹 Компилятор **различает методы** по количеству, типу и порядку аргументов,  
поэтому вызов метода определяется **во время компиляции**.

---

## **Правила перегрузки**
✔ **Методы должны отличаться по количеству или типу параметров**.  
✔ **Возвращаемый тип не влияет на перегрузку** (методы `void print()` и `int print()` считаются одинаковыми).  
✔ **Перегруженные методы могут находиться в одном классе или в классе-наследнике**.

---

## **Пример перегрузки в системе сообщений**

Допустим, у нас есть метод `printDetails()` в классе `Message`,  
который выводит информацию о сообщении.

🔹 Мы можем перегрузить этот метод, чтобы он принимал **разные параметры**:

1️⃣ **Без аргументов** – просто выводит текст сообщения.  
2️⃣ **С аргументом `boolean showSender`** – указывает, нужно ли выводить отправителя.  
3️⃣ **С аргументом `int maxLength`** – ограничивает количество символов.

Таким образом, мы можем вызывать `printDetails()` в разных контекстах,  
а компилятор выберет подходящую версию метода **во время компиляции**.

</details>

-------

<details style="padding-top: 18px">
  <summary><b>Переопределение методов (полиморфизм времени выполнения)</b></summary>

## **Что такое переопределение методов?**

🔹 **Переопределение методов (Method Overriding)** – это механизм, при котором **подкласс предоставляет свою реализацию метода**,  
который уже был определён в родительском классе.

🔹 В отличие от **перегрузки**, переопределение позволяет **изменять поведение метода** без изменения его сигнатуры.  
Решение о том, **какая версия метода будет вызвана, принимается во время выполнения программы**.

---

## **Различие между перегрузкой и переопределением**

| **Характеристика**    | **Перегрузка (Overloading)** | **Переопределение (Overriding)** |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Когда происходит?** | Во время компиляции  | Во время выполнения |
| **Где объявляется?** | В одном классе  | В родительском и дочернем классе |
| **Сигнатура метода** | Разные параметры  | Одинаковые параметры |
| **Цель**  | Расширение функционала метода  | Изменение поведения метода |

---

## **Пример переопределения в системе сообщений**

Ранее мы создали базовый класс `Message` с методом `send()`.  
Теперь каждая конкретная реализация (`SMSMessage`, `WhatsAppMessage`, `EmailMessage`)  
должна **переопределить этот метод**, чтобы реализовать свою логику отправки.

### **Как работает переопределение в данном случае?**

1️⃣ **В родительском классе `Message`** мы объявляем метод `send()`,  
но не знаем, как именно будет отправляться сообщение.

2️⃣ **В каждом подклассе (`SMSMessage`, `WhatsAppMessage`, `EmailMessage`)**  
мы **переопределяем метод `send()`**, чтобы он выполнял **конкретную** отправку.

3️⃣ **При вызове `send()` на объекте `Message`** (например, `message.send()`)  
**будет выполнен метод из фактического типа объекта**.

---

## **Реализация в коде**

```java
// Базовый класс Message
class Message {
protected String text;
protected String sender;
protected String receiver;

    public Message(String text, String sender, String receiver) {
        this.text = text;
        this.sender = sender;
        this.receiver = receiver;
    }

    // Метод send() будет переопределён в подклассах
    public void send() {
        System.out.println("Отправка сообщения...");
    }
}
```

```java
// Подкласс SMSMessage
class SMSMessage extends Message {
public SMSMessage(String text, String sender, String receiver) {
super(text, sender, receiver);
}

    @Override
    public void send() {
        System.out.println("Отправка SMS: " + text + " от " + sender + " к " + receiver);
    }
}
```

```java
// Подкласс WhatsAppMessage
class WhatsAppMessage extends Message {
public WhatsAppMessage(String text, String sender, String receiver) {
super(text, sender, receiver);
}

    @Override
    public void send() {
        System.out.println("Отправка WhatsApp-сообщения: " + text + " от " + sender + " к " + receiver);
    }
}
```

```java
// Подкласс EmailMessage
class EmailMessage extends Message {
public EmailMessage(String text, String sender, String receiver) {
super(text, sender, receiver);
}

    @Override
    public void send() {
        System.out.println("Отправка Email: " + text + " от " + sender + " к " + receiver);
    }
}
```

### **Использование полиморфизма в коде**

```java
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// Создаём массив сообщений разного типа
Message[] messages = {
new SMSMessage("Привет!", "Анна", "Иван"),
new WhatsAppMessage("Как дела?", "Мария", "Алексей"),
new EmailMessage("Важное письмо", "Компания", "Клиент")
};

        // Отправляем все сообщения через общий интерфейс Message
        for (Message message : messages) {
            message.send();
        }
    }
}
```

### **Ожидаемый вывод в консоль:**
```
Отправка SMS: Привет! от Анна к Иван  
Отправка WhatsApp-сообщения: Как дела? от Мария к Алексей  
Отправка Email: Важное письмо от Компания к Клиент  
```

---

## **Вывод**

✅ **Переопределение методов** позволяет подклассам изменять поведение родительского класса.  
✅ **Полиморфизм времени выполнения** позволяет работать с разными объектами через единый интерфейс (`Message`).  
✅ **Пример с сообщениями** показывает, как одно действие (`send()`) может быть реализовано по-разному в зависимости от типа сообщения.

  <summary><b>Использование полиморфизма на практике</b></summary>

## **Переменная суперкласса, указывающая на объект подкласса**

Одно из ключевых преимуществ полиморфизма – возможность объявлять переменные **типа суперкласса**  
и назначать им объекты **разных подклассов**.

Это позволяет **писать универсальный код**, который работает с разными объектами **одним способом**,  
не привязываясь к конкретному подклассу.

**Пример:**
🔹 У нас есть базовый класс `Message` и три подкласса: `SMSMessage`, `WhatsAppMessage`, `EmailMessage`.  
🔹 Мы можем объявить переменную `Message msg`, но присвоить ей **любой** из этих подклассов.

```java
Message msg1 = new SMSMessage("Привет!", "Анна", "Иван");
Message msg2 = new WhatsAppMessage("Как дела?", "Мария", "Алексей");
Message msg3 = new EmailMessage("Важное письмо", "Компания", "Клиент");

## **Полиморфизм в работе: динамический вызов методов**

Когда вызывается метод на переменной суперкласса,  
**реальный метод, который будет выполнен, определяется во время выполнения программы**.

Это называется **динамический вызов методов (Dynamic Method Dispatch)**.  
Java автоматически определяет, **какой именно метод `send()` нужно вызвать**,  
исходя из **фактического типа объекта**.

```java
msg1.send(); // Вызовет send() из SMSMessage
msg2.send(); // Вызовет send() из WhatsAppMessage
msg3.send(); // Вызовет send() из EmailMessage
```

### **Как это работает?**
🔹 Java не смотрит на тип переменной (`Message`), а проверяет, какой **фактический объект** в ней хранится.  
🔹 В момент вызова метода **система ищет его реализацию в фактическом классе** (`SMSMessage`, `WhatsAppMessage` и т. д.).  
🔹 Это позволяет обрабатывать разные типы сообщений **единым способом**.

---

## **Применение полиморфизма в реальном коде**

Используя **полиморфизм**, мы можем, например, создать **список всех сообщений**  
и отправить их в **одном цикле**, даже если они разных типов.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Создаём массив объектов типа Message
        Message[] messages = {
                new SMSMessage("Привет!", "Анна", "Иван"),
                new WhatsAppMessage("Как дела?", "Мария", "Алексей"),
                new EmailMessage("Важное письмо", "Компания", "Клиент")
        };

        // Отправляем все сообщения одним циклом
        for (Message message : messages) {
            message.send();
        }
    }
}
```

### **Вывод в консоль:**
```
Отправка SMS: Привет! от Анна к Иван  
Отправка WhatsApp-сообщения: Как дела? от Мария к Алексей  
Отправка Email: Важное письмо от Компания к Клиент  
```

## **Вывод**
✅ **Полиморфизм позволяет объявлять переменные суперкласса и назначать им объекты подклассов**.  
✅ **Динамический вызов методов** обеспечивает выбор правильной реализации `send()` во время выполнения программы.  
✅ **Благодаря полиморфизму** мы можем работать с разными типами сообщений **единым способом**, не создавая лишнего кода.

  <summary><b>Классная работа: Полиморфизм в системе уведомлений</b></summary>

## **Задание: Применение полиморфизма в системе уведомлений**

🔹 В этом задании вам нужно создать систему уведомлений, которая поддерживает разные каналы доставки.  
🔹 **Шаг 1:** Реализовать базовый класс `Notification` с общими свойствами и методом `send()`.  
🔹 **Шаг 2:** Создать подклассы `PushNotification`, `EmailNotification` и `SMSNotification`, переопределяя `send()`.  
🔹 **Шаг 3:** Использовать полиморфизм для обработки различных уведомлений единым способом.

---

### **Шаг 1: Создание базового класса `Notification`**
✔ Определите поля `message`, `recipient` и `timestamp`.  
✔ Реализуйте метод `send()`, который позже будет переопределён в подклассах.

---

### **Шаг 2: Создание подклассов для различных типов уведомлений**
✔ `PushNotification` – реализует `send()`, имитируя отправку push-уведомления.  
✔ `EmailNotification` – реализует `send()`, имитируя отправку email-уведомления.  
✔ `SMSNotification` – реализует `send()`, имитируя отправку SMS-уведомления.

Каждый подкласс должен **по-своему реализовать метод `send()`**.

---

### **Шаг 3: Использование полиморфизма в классе `Main`**
✔ Создайте массив или список объектов `Notification`, содержащий разные типы уведомлений.  
✔ Проитерируйте коллекцию и вызовите `send()` для каждого уведомления.  
✔ Обратите внимание, как Java автоматически вызывает нужную версию метода `send()` в зависимости от типа объекта.
